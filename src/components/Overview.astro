			## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

			We're not in the business of telling you what to do, but here we are. . . telling you what to do. ðŸ¤£

			Don't worry! Our hope is that these guidelines and "best" (in quotes because... what do we know?) practices will help facilitate a baseline for our team and unify our [code] style, in-turn reducing cognitive overload when context switching. These are inteded to be helpful guidelines, not an overwhelming set of "**YOU MUST DO THIS OR ELSE!**".

			The 'lay of the land' is below, but you are welcome to start anywhere that piques your interest in the primary navigation. And if you find any issues or have any suggestions for how to improve these docs, feel free to submit a PR!

			## ðŸš€ Project Structure

			Inside of this documentation, you'll see the following folders and files:

			```
			/
			â”œâ”€â”€ public/
			â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
			â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ robots.txt
			â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
			â”œâ”€â”€ src/
			â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
			â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Nav/
			â”‚   â”‚   			â””â”€â”€ Nav.astro
			â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PageNav/
			â”‚   â”‚   			â””â”€â”€ PageNav.astro
			â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Head.astro
			â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Overview.astro // the content of this page
			â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
			â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
			â””â”€â”€ package.json
			```

			Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory.
			Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

			There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

			Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
